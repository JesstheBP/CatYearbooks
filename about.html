	<h1 style="font-size:10px">I am a devoted cat lover and am the owner of 4 beautiful kitties named: Jonesey, Merlin, Capitan, and Darla. I can’t remember a time when I didn’t have a cat. Going on 55+ years now always having a cat. Cats are the perfect companion for all age groups. 

</h1> <img src="logo.png" alt="us!">
	<h1 style="font-size:10px">All 4 were strays that I adopted. I am constantly taking polaroids of my furbabies and sharing them with my red hat society gals. I thought, why not capture these beautiful pictures and the wacky things they do and create a yearbook to remember how they’ve grown each year. Plus, these make wonderful gift ideas for family and friends. Just ask mine! Cat yearbooks are going to be the next big craze. Which is why I’ve created this easy to use web site all about cat yearbooks. This is your one stop shop to build and buy your kitty yearbook. Again, don’t forget to buy an extra or two for your friends and family. They aren’t going to want to miss the fun and crazy things your fur babies are doing. </h1>
